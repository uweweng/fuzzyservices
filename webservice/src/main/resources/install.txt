I. Introduction
===============

Thank you for downloading this part of Fuzzy Services. It belongs to a program 
library for processing fuzzy information. It is implemented in the Java 
programming language and distributed under the GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE.



II. System Requirements and Installation
========================================

In general, you need a Java Runtime Environment (JRE). Fuzzy Services in this 
version are build and tested with 1.5.0_09. The JRE is not part of this 
package. You can get it from http://java.sun.com.

If you downloaded an enterprise component of Fuzzy Services (called with prefix 
Fuzzy Services EE) it is required a so-called application server, too. The 
packages are prepared for BEA Weblogic (TM) and JBoss Application Server (TM),
because they contain product provider depending deployment descriptors. 
But, Fuzzy Services do not have any special requirements for such environments.
Therefore, the deployment on other application servers may be also possible. 
If you find out any incompatibilities please let me know.

The installation of Fuzzy Services Core and JavaBeans is really simple. 
Add the downloaded Java Archive file (JAR) to your CLASSPATH environment 
variable, eg:

  export CLASSPATH=/fuzzyservices-core-1.0.jar:$CLASSPATH
or
  set CLASSPATH="c:\fuzzyservices-core-1.0.jar";%CLASSPATH%

It is also possible to add the archive to the start command of your 
application:

  java -cp fuzzyservices-core-1.0.jar my.application.Main

Have in mind, that the JavaBeans package needs Fuzzy Services Core.


Fuzzy Services EE components are delivered as prepared EJB-JARs with appropriate 
deployment descriptors. Please refer to the documentation of your application 
server in order to deploy the JAR into the container.
