I. Introduction
===============

Thank you for downloading this part of JFuzzy. JFuzzy is a program library for 
processing fuzzy information. It is implemented in the Java programming 
language and distributed under the GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE.



II. System Requirements and Installation
========================================

In general, you need a Java Runtime Environment (JRE). JFuzzy in this version is 
build and tested with 1.5.0_09. The JRE is not part of this package. You can 
get it from http://java.sun.com.

If you downloaded an enterprise component of JFuzzy (called with prefix 
JFuzzy EE) it is required a so-called application server, too. The packages are 
prepared for BEA Weblogic (TM) and JBoss Application Server (TM), because they 
contain product provider depending deployment descriptors. But, JFuzzy do not 
have any special requirements for such environments. Therefore, the deployment 
on other application servers may be also possible. If you find out any 
incompatibilities please let us know.

The installation of JFuzzy Core and JavaBeans is really simple. 
Add the downloaded Java Archive file (JAR) to your CLASSPATH environment 
variable, eg:

  export CLASSPATH=/jfuzzy-core-1.0.jar:$CLASSPATH
or
  set CLASSPATH="c:\jfuzzy-core-1.0.jar";%CLASSPATH%

It is also possible to add the archive to the start command of your 
application:

  java -cp jfuzzy-core-1.0.jar my.application.Main

Have in mind, that the JavaBeans package need JFuzzy Core.


JFuzzy EE components are delivered as prepared EJB-JARs with appropriate 
deployment descriptors. Please refer to the documentation of your application 
server in order to deploy the JAR into the container.
